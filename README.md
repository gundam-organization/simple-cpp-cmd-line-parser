## Synopsis

Are you getting sick of always writing the same piece of code to get various
command line arguments? Well, search no more since Simple C++ CmdLineParser
does this job for you! Indeed, as a header-only library you just have to
`#include "CmdLineParser.h"` at the beginning of you code, and that's all:
no extra library to include, you're in! :D


## Example

As an example is always better to show a summary of what it does, take a look
at the `example/main.cpp` file:
